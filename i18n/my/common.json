We have a particular focus on sustainable education – and by this we mean life-long and life-sustaining education: from children in school, to farmers trying new methods in the field, to women’s groups learning to run cooperatives, and more! Addressing the interconnected problems faced in these communities, we also aim to improve food security, promote inclusion, and meet urgent needs in times of crisis. Learn more about who we are.",
